# Overview
CollabLLM transforms traditional language models from passive responders to active collaborators in multi-turn conversations. This repository provides the complete framework for computing multiturn-aware rewards and training collaborative language models.

---
## Installation

To get started, create a new environment and install `collabllm` via [pip](https://pypi.org/project/collabllm/):

```bash
conda create -n collabllm python=3.10
conda activate collabllm
pip install collabllm
```

### Optional: For distributed training
If you need distributed training:

```bash
pip install deepspeed
conda install mpi4py
```

### Optional: For customized datasets and metrics
You may install additional packages (e.g., `pip install bigcodebench matplotlib`) for task-specific metrics or evaluation.

# Quick Start

- Lightweight usage: Compute Multiturn-aware Rewards (MRs) for any model responses and construct datasets following `notebook_tutorials/`.
- Synthetic data generation: Generating high-quality synthetic conversational data following `scripts/engine/build_dataset.py`. (Include your API keys in `.env` file)
- Train CollabLLM: Conduct SFT/DPO models training to maximize MRs following examples under `scripts/train/*.py`. 


## Add Your Own Task

To apply CollabLLM to a new task:

1. **Add a Dataset:**  
   Place your single-turn dataset in `examples/single_turn_ds/` and register it in `__init__.py`.

2. **(Optional) Add Metrics:**  
   Add new metrics to `examples/metrics/` and register them in `__init__.py`.

You can now run data generation, reward computation, and model training using your customized setup.
